.mli files. Compile by typing the following on the command line:

The game works best full screen. All instructions and commands 
are outlined on the title screen.

1920 x 1080 is the recommended screen resolution.
If you cannot see everything on the first card screen without 
scrolling up, reducing the font size on the terminal may 
improve your user experience. Please go to Edit > Preferences. 
Size 8 works for most screens.
